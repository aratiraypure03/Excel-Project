# End-to-End Sales Tracking Project

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end implementation of a sales tracking and performance analysis system, created using Excel. The workbook provides insights into sales performance across various regions and tracks key metrics such as total sales, target achievements, and deviations from goals.

## File Description

The workbook consists of two sheets:

1. **DASHBOARD**:  
   - A visual and tabular representation of sales performance.  
   - Includes metrics like total sales, target hit percentages, and away-from-target percentages, categorized by sales executives.  
   - Organized to provide quick, actionable insights.  

2. **RAW DATA**:  
   - Contains detailed daily sales data for each sales executive.  
   - Columns include:
     - `Emp Code`: Unique identifier for employees.
     - `Sales Executive`: Names of sales representatives.
     - `Region`: The geographic location of operations.
     - `Day1` through `Day5`: Daily sales figures.
     - `Total Sales`: Aggregated sales over the five days.
     - `Target`: Predefined sales goals.
     - `Target Hit %` and `Away From Target %`: Performance metrics.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: Summarizes sales data and highlights performance in intuitive tables.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks sales against targets to assess efficiency.
- **Region-wise Analysis**: Helps identify strong and weak areas geographically.
